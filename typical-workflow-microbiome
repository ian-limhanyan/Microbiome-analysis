## A typical workflow for microbiome analyses.

# Considering you have a phyloseq object ready, we can do some exploratory microbiome analyses.
# In this example, our aim is to compare the gut profile of individuals before vs after consuming probiotics.
# The workflow is as follows:
# 1) Alpha diversity
# 2) Beta diversity 
# 3) Relative abundance 
# 4) Differential abundance analysis

# Load main R packages for microbiome analysis
library(ggplot2)    # For graphical visualizations.
library(ggsignif)   # For adding significance annotations to ggplot2 plots
library(Maaslin2)   # For studying multivariable associations.
library(microbiome) # For extending phyloseq & provides tools for manipulation, analysis, visualization etc.
library(phyloseq)   # For importing, storing, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing high-throughput microbiome census data.
library(vegan)      # For community ecology analysis consisting methods such as ordination, diversity, clustering, etc.
